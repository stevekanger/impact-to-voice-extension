# Impact To Google Voice Extension

This extension is for me to be able to send tel links from impact to Google Voice or Text Now with just a right click.

## Installation

Only tested on chromium based browsers. Google Chrome and Brave.

Go to browser menu > extensions and toggle developer mode in the top right. Then load unpacked in top left and choose the extension folder.

## Usage

The extension is disabled by default. You can enable it by clicking the extension icon and toggling it on. You can pin it to the address bar and a green or red dot will appear on the icon when it is enabled or disabled. Choose which service you want to call from, Google Voice or Text Now.

When the extension is enabled you can just right click on the phone buttons in impact and if you have a google voice tab open it will send the phone number to google voice and call.
